# Issues 

1. "Instead we have ILD (Interstitial Lung Disease), which is a diverse and varied set of findings and possible pathologies. We have calcification / nodule/mass / lung opacity / other lesion, which will have a bit of overlap I suspect."
2. Ensure model computes loss on images with no bboxes.
3. Reduce impact of rotation to bounding box sizes, instead of rotating the corners, rotate two points at each edge, choose min/max of rotated points.
4. Adress the labeling process.

##### data
1. R9 highlightes more boxes than others

# Stolen ideas

1. Modify architecture for small boxes? Like nodule/mass
2. Add classification in output using glogal labels from original dataset. Lung opacity? 
3. Ensembles
4. TTA
5. Create labeling simulation.
